<h1>Description</h1>
This project is about finding a profitable 
forecasting trading strategy 
on the FOREX market on historical data, and use the historical data to train a naive bayes classifier. The classifier should then make a prediction on whether, the next trade you enter should be a long or a short position. In order to minimize the scop of the project, we have choosen to limit ourself to only use data and trade on the EUR/USD currency pair
