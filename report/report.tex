\begin{abstract}
This project will utilize the fact, that history is bound to repeat itself. Especially during in trading situations, where there is little to no fluctuations. We will try to grasp the power of the history by making use of old market data from the forex market on one of the most traded currency pairs EUR vs USD. We will get the historical data from Oanda using their API for python. We will learn from the past success from our previous trading and use the lessons learned from these trades, to train a classifier, which can then tell us when and how to trade.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
We all know the lovely feeling of having money in our pockets, however we also know how hard it is, and how much work needs to be done in order to get money. But what if all that is about to change, what if you could have somebody doing it for you, and you earn money on their hard work?\\
	Well this is really what leadership is all about, letting some one do the work, you take the risk if they do it wrong, but most of the time the employees do it right and the owner makes profit. However this project isn't about leadership, since not everybody can be a leader, what we suggest instead to make use of the power of computers or to be more precise an automated trading bot, that trades 24/7 every weekday on your behalf.\\
	This bot will use the oanda's API, and in that way get a currency data and make trades based on it.
For retrieving the data as well as making trades we will use machine learning with python, and in that way hopefully end up with some sort of profit.


\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Getting data}
We obtain all the financial data of the financial instrument EUR vs USD, on a 5 minute timeframe from oanda, using their own REST API for python. From oanda's API we get the financial charts of a 7 year time period, going from 2007-10-01 to 2014-10-20. After obtaining the data, it is stored in json fileformat in a file called "fxdata.txt", this data will then be used both to form our hypothosis of forex trading on the EUR vs USD currency pair, as well as performing a trading simulation on this set of data. However in order for us to use the naive Bayes classifier, we need to have two dataset's and not just a single one. In our domain the one dataset needs to be the trades which gained profit, and the other set needs consist of the trades which lost. We then have the possibility to analyze the data with different sets of features.\\
\\
The pseudo code of the random trading algorithm, where we will keep the orders for no more than 20 minutes:

\begin{center}
\begin{algorithmic}
\While{$streamFinancialData$}
	\State {$i = random(0,10)$}
	\If {$i = 0$}
    	\State {$openOrder(short)$}
	\ElsIf{$i = 1$}
    	\State $openOrder(long)$	    
	\EndIf
	\For{$order\: in\: orders$}	
		\If{$order.hasProfit()$}
			\State{$profitList.append(order)$}
			\State{$order.close()$}
		\ElsIf{$order.hasLoss()$}
			\State{$lossList.append(order)$}
			\State{$order.close()$}
		\ElsIf{$order.duration >= 4$}
			\State{$order.close()$}
		\Else
			\State{$order.duration += 1$}
		\EndIf
	\EndFor
\EndWhile
\State{$saveListToFile(profitList,"profit.txt")$}
\State{$saveListToFile(lossList,"loss.txt")$}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{center}

This algorithm should theoretically give us equally profitable trades in both the long and the short direction.

\subsection{Specific features}
To analyse the data we use a supervised classification learning algorithm, or to be more specific we use a naive Bayes classifier. The idea is to use a naive Bayes classifier, on our financial data that we gathered using our random algorithm. This isn't a new concept, in fact there are a couple of scientific articles on this already, as can be seen in the article by KAWABATA and TAKATA \cite{fxNaiveBayes}.\\ 
We will train the classifier on some specific features, accordingly to what we found on the internet. One of the indicators many beginners are told to use, are two moving averages, and when the functions cross it's an indicator to enter a trade, and also in what direction to enter the trade, the reasons why this is a good idea is explained in this video \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_csKQ6iqx4} from a website called "Financialtradingschool.com", he also explains about Price Action and how to use it in a strategy in the following video \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FPfY1z1MyA}. So far we know, that we should look at two SMA functions, a slow and a fast, and look at when they cross. We also know that we should look at the prices directly in order to use it for Price Action, however since Price Action really is just a strategy to trade if the price reaches a certain point, we let our classifier doing the job, of defining when to trade or not directly based on the current prices of the currencies. Another indicator we found using the powerful internet was the relative strength index or the RSI indicator as it, is called in finance. Directly cited from \url{http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp}\\
\\
("A technical momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses in an attempt to determine overbought and oversold conditions of an asset.").\\ \\

This basically translate to, that if the RSI indicator gets to 70 or above, it is a good indicator that you should make a short trade, and likewise if the RSI approaches 30 or below it is very likely a good idea to open a long trade. However we let our classifier determine whether it's a good idea to trade, depending on what the RSI level is directly. 
Due to our research on investment strategies our classifier should use the following features.

\begin{itemize}
	\item{CrossGraph(SMA(10,40))}
	\item{RSI(period=100)}
	\item{openBid(period=1)}
	\item{closeBid(period=1)}
	\item{volume(period=1)}
	\item{spread(period=1)}
	%\item{Parabolic SAR default settings (0.02, 0.2)}
	%\item{MACD default settings (fast=12, slow = 15, period=9)}
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}
Before we start trading, we need to train our classifier based on the feature set we mentioned in the analysis. After the training is completed, we can then start trading based on our historical data. 
After a completed run of the historical data, the result of the trade is then shown on a graph, showing the profit/loss of a 5 minute interval. Figure 1. is showing a flowchart of how the trading cycles. From this we know that we need a driver to run the program, that retrieves signals from either the Random trader or the classifier, depending on what is chosen. The driver then creates orders of trades, but to keep track of them all, we need an order manager. The driver also needs to be able to withdraw/deposit money to an account manager. Figure 2. is showing the class diagram on how we will implement it all.\\

\section{Test \& Results}
\subsection{Test}
Our control test are made by running the program on the data.txt(roughly 23 days), with a leverage at 20, an account on 10000\$, and set the confidence level of the classifier at 96\%. When the program have gone though data, we retrieve the profit/loss. Hereafter we deviate one variable from the control, firstly we change the leverage to 400, then we change the confidence level of the classifier to 85\%.\\
We also want to check different datasets, the largest dataset goes from 2007 to 2014(, roughly 2557 days), then we use a data set that is newer than the control, going from 2014/11/10 - 2014/12/03(roughly 24 days) and the last data we go through is roughly a single day, the 2014/12/03, with a 5 second interval.\\
\\
We also test the random trader to see how effective it is, on both the control data and the large data.\footnote{The result may differ because the trade is random}\\
\\
We have generated graphs for each test, that shows the profit/loss on each interval, and the exchange rate for EUR/USD on each interval.\footnote{See appendix for all graphs}

Now that we have several test data, with the profit and by knowing how many days each data spanned over, we calculate the daily profit/loss for each test.

\section{Discussion}

By changing some of the variables for the control data, we retrieve a result for the control data, one with the leverage on 400 and one with the confidence level on 85\%.\\
In these cases, the test with leverage on 400 gets the best result, even though we multiply the leverage with 20, the profit gained is more than 20 times the control(, it is 25 times more). This is due to that each time we make a trade we use 2\%, of the current account balance, which is capital projection. Changing the leverage creates a bigger risk, but might also improve the gain.\\
When we reduce the confidence level to 85\%, the classifier opens more trades, that have a higher risk, than with the leverage. This is duo to that you might get profit on more trades but the profit on each trade is closely the same, but duo to the higher risk you might also loose profit on more orders than earlier.\\
So if lowering the confidence level was a higher risk, then raising the confidence level will lower the risk. This is somewhat true, because raising the confidence level to high, only prevents the classifier of making any orders and therefore never trades.\\  
\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{data-96-10000-20.png}
    \caption{This is a graph of the closed profit, on the control data, with a 5 min interval.}
\end{figure}
\\
The next three result are where we keep the variables the same, but change the data we test on. So far we have had profit on each test, but with the large dataset, we get a closed profit of about -7250. Even though it might seem a lot, it is less than 3 dollars a day, spanning over 7 years. This shows that even with a confidence level on 96\%, you still might lose your money. By looking at the graph for the large data\footnote{See appendix for graph}, we see that in the beginning, the classifier creates positive profit, but as we go on it looses. This might be because that we do not update the classifier each state.\\
\\
We therefore also made a test data, that was newer than both the large data and the control data. By looking at this graph\footnote{See appendix for graph}, we see that the classifier makes less trades, but also makes some larger mistakes. Even though we end in a profit with this data set, it is around 12 times less than in the control data. This confirms our theory that the classifier needs to be updated regularly to be able to work properly.
\\
\\
So far all our data have been collected over several day's, with a 5 min interval. We therefore decided to have a data set from a single day, with a 5 sec interval instead. This gave us the most profitable closed profit, at two times more than the control, a day.\\
\\
To see how well our classifier works, we use our Random trader with both the control data, and the larger data, these test represents how a normal person might trade. We ran these test several times, and not a single time did we end with a positive closed profit. This is quite expected, and also shows that without having knowledge of professional trader, or in our case having a bot trading for you.

\section{Conclusion}
Through this process we have gathered several data sets, some larger than others, and used these to train a classifier to automatically make trades based on financial signals. All but one of the test from the classifier have resulted in a positive closed profit, the profit is even made regardless of the interval chosen even through the classifier is trained on 5-min interval it does well when given the opportunity to perform on a 5-sec interval. All of these profits indicates that our classifier enters it's  trades on the correct time and with the correct guess. We also show that using our classifier to trade, is better than letting a normal person trade randomly, because we get a profit with our classifier and loss with the random trader, on the same dataset. 
In order to improve our classifier, we would need to implement an updater, that trains the classifier with the newest data each interval, by deleting the oldest data and add the newest. Most of our current features are also some that people who is just learning about FX trading will know, therefore using other more intricate features might result in lower risk and hopefully a higher profit. By creating this classifier and making it trade for us, it is possible to let it trade for us and get profit, but there still is some risk. This fits perfectly with the economics theory, that there doesn't exist free arbitrage opportunities on the market, and if they really exist they are used and exploited in the blink of an eye\url{http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp}.
